Template showing several different layouts and options for beamer
slides produced with org-mode.

There seeems to be some some conflict with hyperref when exporting directly to pdf.
I found two solutions:
- add the needed \RequirePackage line with sed in the Makefile
  (need to export tex first, then =make=)
- export tex -> latex *tex -> dvipdf hyperref

Mostly based on:
